# Operator runbook

What you need to run AL Dev Toolbox for paying users. Each section is a flow,
not a tour of the codebase. Treat the bullet at the end of each section as the
acceptance check.

## Volume layout

The compose stack mounts three named volumes. Back up what's in `pg-data` and
`app-keys` together; backups in `app-backups` are a convenience layer on top.

| Volume        | Mount path inside `aldevtoolbox` | What it holds                                                    |
|---------------|----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `pg-data`     | (mounted on `db` service)        | Postgres data files — the only thing that *needs* a real backup. |
| `app-keys`    | `/var/lib/aldevtoolbox/dp-keys`  | ASP.NET Data Protection key ring. Loss invalidates all login cookies and decrypts of the stored SMTP password. |
| `app-backups` | `/var/lib/aldevtoolbox/backups`  | `pg_dump` files written by the in-app backup tooling.            |

Verify: `docker volume ls | grep aldevtoolbox` shows three volumes after the
first `docker compose up`.

## Fresh deploy

1. Pick a Postgres password and a bootstrap admin password. The bootstrap
   admin password is read once on a fresh database; rotate it from
   `/account` after first sign-in.

   ```bash
   export POSTGRES_PASSWORD=$(openssl rand -hex 16)
   export BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@example.com
   export BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_PASSWORD=$(openssl rand -base64 18)
   ```

2. Bring up the stack. The first boot runs migrations and seeds the Default
   organisation; expect `/readyz` to take ~30–60 s to turn green on a fresh
   `pg-data` volume.

   ```bash
   docker compose up --build -d
   curl --fail --silent --show-error http://localhost:8080/readyz
   ```

3. Sign in as the bootstrap email. The first user is stamped
   `IsSiteAdmin = true`, so the **Site Admin** section appears in the sidebar.
   Visit `/site-admin/settings` and fill in SMTP. Promote a second SiteAdmin
   from `/site-admin/users` so you're not a single point of failure.

4. Hide `/signup` at the reverse proxy if the deployment is invite-only. The
   page is wired but exposed under the bare hostname by default.

Verify: `curl http://localhost:8080/healthz` returns 200; signed-in admin sees
the **Site Admin** sidebar entry.

## Scheduled backup

The in-app scheduler runs `pg_dump -Fc` against the live database and writes
to the `app-backups` volume.

1. Visit `/site-admin/settings`. Under **Backups**, tick **Enable scheduled
   backups** and set the UTC time of day (default 02:00). Save.
2. Set the retention count on the same page. After each backup, files past
   the retention count that aren't pinned are pruned. Pin anything you want
   to keep indefinitely from `/site-admin/backups`.
3. To see the scheduler fire without waiting overnight, set the schedule
   time a minute or two ahead of now. The scheduler polls every minute.

Verify: a row appears under `/site-admin/backups` with kind *Scheduled*
within five minutes of the scheduled time. The `app-backups` volume holds the
file.

## Manual backup

For pre-upgrade or ad-hoc captures.

1. Visit `/site-admin/backups`. Click **Take a backup now**. A row appears
   with kind *Ad-hoc* and a download link.
2. Pin the row before doing anything destructive — unpinned rows roll off
   under retention.
3. To copy the file off the host:

   ```bash
   docker compose cp aldevtoolbox:/var/lib/aldevtoolbox/backups/<filename> ./
   ```

Verify: `docker compose exec aldevtoolbox ls /var/lib/aldevtoolbox/backups`
lists the file.

## In-place restore

Destructive. Drops the `public` schema and replays the dump. The app enters
maintenance mode (503 for non-SiteAdmin) for the duration; SiteAdmin requests
and `/healthz` / `/readyz` keep going.

1. Take a fresh manual backup first (see above). If the restore goes sideways
   you want a known-good snapshot to roll back to.
2. `/site-admin/backups`, find the target row, click **Restore**. Tick the
   confirmation checkbox and submit.
3. While the restore runs, every non-SiteAdmin request gets a static
   maintenance page with the start time. The page polls; signed-in users see
   the app come back automatically when the restore completes.
4. The restore writes an audit row with kind *Restore*. Review
   `/site-admin/audit` afterwards.

Verify: post-restore, `/readyz` is 200 and `/site-admin/audit` shows the
*Restore* entry. Non-SiteAdmin sign-in works.

If the restore fails part-way, the database is in an indeterminate state —
restore the most recent pre-restore backup to roll back, then investigate.

## SMTP rotation

1. `/site-admin/settings`. Update **SMTP password** (the rest of the SMTP
   block can stay as-is). Save.
2. Click **Send test email to me**. A 200 means SMTP is reachable; failures
   show inline with the SMTP error text.
3. The stored password is encrypted with the Data Protection key ring. Don't
   delete `app-keys` between rotations — the existing ciphertext becomes
   unreadable.

Verify: the test email arrives. `/site-admin/audit` shows a *SystemSettings*
update row redacted to `<redacted>` for the password field.

## SiteAdmin promotion and demotion

SiteAdmin is org-scoped to **Default** at first, but the role itself crosses
orgs — a SiteAdmin sees `/site-admin/*` regardless of which org they belong
to.

1. **Promote.** `/site-admin/users`. Find the user, tick the **Site admin**
   column. The change is audited with both before/after rows.
2. **Demote.** Same page, untick. The "last SiteAdmin" guard refuses to
   demote the only remaining SiteAdmin — promote someone else first.
3. **Lost SiteAdmin.** If every SiteAdmin loses access, bring up a one-off
   container with `BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_EMAIL` / `BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_PASSWORD` set
   to a new email — the bootstrap path runs only against an empty database,
   so this is a recovery-from-empty path, not a back door. The supported
   recovery is to restore from a backup taken when SiteAdmin still worked,
   or to SQL-update `users.is_site_admin = true` directly against the
   `pg-data` volume.

Verify: the promoted user sees the **Site Admin** sidebar entry on next
sign-in. `/site-admin/users` refuses to demote the last SiteAdmin.

## Recovering from lost Data Protection keys

If `app-keys` is wiped, all signed-in cookies become invalid (users get
redirected to login) and the encrypted SMTP password becomes unreadable.

1. Recreate the volume by restarting the app — the startup code recreates the
   directory and a fresh key ring.
2. Every user signs in again. The cookie ring rotates without their
   intervention; nothing else breaks.
3. The SMTP password column is now ciphertext that no key can decrypt. Visit
   `/site-admin/settings`, re-enter the password, save. The next email send
   uses the freshly-encrypted value.
4. Audit log entries that captured the encrypted SMTP password before the
   loss stay redacted; they were already redacted at write time.

Verify: `/healthz` returns 200 after the restart; sending a test email from
`/site-admin/settings` succeeds.

## Migrating from a v1 (SQLite) deployment

See [`.design/migrating-from-sqlite.md`](../.design/migrating-from-sqlite.md).
The path is: export TOML from the v1 admin UI, bring up the v2 compose stack
against a fresh `pg-data`, sign in as the bootstrap admin, import the TOML
from `/admin/configuration`.
