# Both base images are pinned by digest so two builds of the same commit produce
# byte-identical layers — the release model in PROJECT.md tags a commit that has
# already passed CI, which a floating tag quietly undermines. Bump the digests
# deliberately (`docker buildx imagetools inspect <image>:<tag>`); the comment
# line directly above each FROM records which tag the digest was resolved from.

# curl is needed for the HEALTHCHECK below; the slim aspnet image no longer
# ships it. git is needed by the customer-build pipeline to clone customer
# repositories before compiling (the AL compiler itself is provisioned at
# runtime into a volume, not baked here — see AlCompilerProvisioner).
# postgresql-client-18 supplies pg_dump / pg_restore, which the M18
# BackupService shells out to. pg_dump refuses to dump a server newer than
# itself, so the client major must match the compose db image (postgres:18).
# Debian's default postgresql-client is older than 18, so we install from the
# PGDG apt repo to keep client and server in lockstep.
