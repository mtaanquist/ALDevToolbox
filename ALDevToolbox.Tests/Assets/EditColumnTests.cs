/// Guards the second half of #549: <c>.edit-col</c> was ported and then never

///
/// <para>The design system is unusually explicit about this one
/// (<c>PagesForms.dc.html</c>): <i>"single column capped at 900px; forms do not
/// get wider than they can be read. The audit panel sits <b>outside</b> that
/// column, at full content width: it is a log, not a form, and the diff lines
/// are the one thing on the page that genuinely wants the extra
/// characters."</i> Both halves of that sentence are load-bearing, so both are
/// checked: a page that wrapped its audit panel in the column would look tidy
/// and would have thrown away the width the log needs.</para>
///
/// <para>Measured before the fix, at 1600px: the module and recipe edit cards
/// were 1304px with text inputs stretched to 625px, while the caption beside
/// them capped at 68ch and left 864px empty. Two pages had already reached
/// ~890-905px on their own by hand, which is the best evidence that 900 is the
/// right number.</para>
