# Migrating onto the Business Central design system

Working doc for the `design/bc-system` integration branch. The brief that
produced the design is `design-system-brief.md`; the handoff itself is in
`handoff/` (see `handoff/README.md` for what is imported and how to pull more).

This doc records **what we found when we measured the port**, **the decisions
that need a human**, and **the PR order**. Update it as each PR lands.

## Where the work happens

`design/bc-system` is a long-lived integration branch off `main`. Each step
below is its own PR **targeting `design/bc-system`**, not `main`; the branch
merges to `main` once the app is fully migrated and green. Branch names follow
the repo convention with a `design/` type prefix — `design/tokens`,
`design/shell`, `design/tool-translator`.

Migrating tool-by-tool is the point: each PR moves one surface onto the shared
system **and deletes that surface's bespoke CSS in the same PR**, so the old and
new never coexist long enough to drift.

**Health metric: `wwwroot/tools.css` line count.** 5,472 at the start. It only
goes down. When it hits zero the migration is done.

## What we measured

### The token layer is a safe drop-in

Every custom property the app reads is either defined in the new `tokens.css` or
was **already a dead reference** before this work. Checked mechanically:

```
grep -rhoE 'var\(--[a-zA-Z0-9-]+' --include=*.css --include=*.razor \
  ALDevToolbox/wwwroot ALDevToolbox/Components | sed 's/var(//' | sort -u
```

18 names came back "not in the new token layer". Four (`--st-todo`,
`--st-todo-bg`, `--st-review`, `--st-review-bg`) are declared locally in
`Translator.razor.css` and are self-contained. The other **14 were never
declared anywhere in the app** and have been silently resolving to their
hardcoded `var(--x, #fallback)` second argument:

`--accent` `--border-color` `--border-muted` `--line` `--r-md` `--radius-md`
`--radius-sm` `--source-viewer-outline-width` `--surface-1` `--surface-hover`
`--text-1` `--text-2` `--text-3` `--text-muted`

Two things worth fixing on the way past:

- `base.css:714` uses bare `var(--line)` with **no fallback** — that declaration
  has no effect today.
- Several fallbacks bake *dark-theme* greys in unconditionally, e.g.
  `var(--text-1, #d8d8e0)` and `var(--surface-1, #1a1c22)` in `tools.css`. Those
  render dark-mode colours on the light theme right now.

This is exactly the drift the design system exists to stop, and it is a good
argument for the "no `#` in a component layer" non-negotiable.

### What the token swap reaches, and what it doesn't

Colour and type re-point globally the moment `tokens.css` loads. Shape only
re-points where the radius was already tokenised. Counts per stylesheet:

| File | hardcoded hex | `rgba()` | `border-radius: Npx` | `border-radius: var(--r*)` |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `base.css` | 3 | 2 | 12 | 12 |
| `tools.css` | **88** | **60** | **87** | 79 |
| `admin.css` | 13 | 14 | 7 | 13 |
| `auth.css` | 3 | 0 | 0 | 2 |
| scoped `*.razor.css` | 19 | - | 37 | - |

`base.css` and `auth.css` are nearly clean and mostly came along for free.
`tools.css` is where the drift lives, and it is why the migration is
tool-by-tool rather than one sweep.

## Decisions that need a call

The design agent worked greenfield. These are the places where it made a choice
we have to accept, adapt, or reject — worth settling before the component PR,
because each one ripples.

1. **Square corners.** `--r` drops 8px → **2px**, `--r-control` 2px; `--r-pill`
   is reserved for status pills, avatars and progress bars. This is deliberately
   BC-native and it is the single biggest visual change. Because the tokens flip
   globally, the *tokenised* radii went square immediately — but ~136 hardcoded
   `Npx` radii did not, so the app is currently **mixed** until each tool
   migrates. Accepting this means committing to finish.

2. **The primary button is not the brand teal.** `#00B7C3` measures 2.5:1
   against white, so `.btn--primary` fills with `--primary-strong` `#008089`
   and the bright teal is reserved for accents, keylines, focus rings and active
   bars. That is correct for contrast, but it means "BC teal" reads as a deep
   teal in the loudest place. Look at the screenshots before signing off.

3. **The font stack has no non-Windows fallback.**
   `"Segoe UI","Segoe WP",Segoe,device-segoe,Tahoma,Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif`
   is BC's own stack and is right on Windows. On macOS it lands on Helvetica and
   on Linux on whatever generic sans is installed — neither is that platform's
   UI font. Recommend inserting `system-ui, -apple-system` after the Segoe
   entries and before `Tahoma`. Cheap, and invisible to the Windows majority.

4. **Status changes shape and meaning.** `.status-pill` becomes a squared tag
   with a 3px left keyline instead of a rounded lozenge, and the system adds a
   rule: **pills are for cards, detail headers and inline text — never for table
   rows.** Rows carry status as a 4px right edge bar (`.data-table--edge` +
   `tr.is-succeeded`). That is an information-design change, not a restyle: it
   touches `BuildStatusPill`, `DeliveryStatusPill`, and every status column in
   Pipelines, Releases and Projects. Decide whether we take the row rule.

5. **`.is-*` for runtime state, `--modifier` for variants.** The design uses
   `.is-active` / `.is-selected` / `.is-open` / `.is-checked`; we currently use
   `.theme-toggle__btn--active`. The design's split is the better convention and
   is one of its stated rules — adopt it, and rename ours as each component moves.
   Note the handoff also ships `.is-hover` / `.is-focus` as spec-sheet display
   aids; those are the ones safe to drop, the state ones are not.

6. **New components with no current equivalent.** `.cue` (BC activity tiles),
   `.switch`, `.skeleton`, `.toast`, `.alert`, `.header-tabs`, `.steps`.
   `.skeleton` and `.toast` fill real gaps (we render bare "Loading..." text and
   have no confirmation feedback). `.cue` is a genuine BC idiom for the admin
   dashboard. Take them as their page needs them, per CLAUDE.md — not up front.

7. **Modern CSS.** `shell.css` uses container queries against a `.shell-root`
   wrapper, and `color-mix()` appears in the focus halo, modal backdrop and
   reconnect overlay. Both are fine for our targets, but they are new to this
   codebase and worth knowing before someone "fixes" them.

Density tokens (`--control-h`, `--row-h`, `.u-compact`) are declared but nothing
consumes them yet — they only start mattering as components migrate.

## PR order

**1. Token layer** — *landed on this branch.* `wwwroot/tokens.css` added as a
verbatim copy of the handoff, the `:root` blocks cut out of `base.css`
(lines 10-189), and the stylesheet linked ahead of `base.css` in `App.razor`.
No markup changed. Verified: `dotnet build` green, app runs, Home and the
workspace generator render in both themes.

**2. Housekeeping** (tiny, unblocks measurement) — add the `system-ui` fallback
per decision 3, delete the 14 dead `var()` references above, and fix the
unconditional dark greys in `tools.css`.

**3. Core components** — port `handoff/components.css` into the shared layer and
move `.btn`, `.field` / `.input`, `.status-pill`, `.data-table`, `.card`,
`.module-card`, `.confirm-dialog`, `.menu` / `.ra`, `.pill-tab` onto it,
deleting the `base.css` and `tools.css` versions. Most class names already match
— the renames are `.confirm-modal__*` → `.confirm-dialog__*`, `.page-header` →
`.page-head`, `.field__input` → `.input`, and the `--active` → `.is-active`
sweep. Settle decisions 4 and 5 here.

**4. Shell** — `MainLayout`, `NavMenu`, `ThemeToggle`, `ReconnectModal` onto
`handoff/shell.css`. Renames: `.app-shell` → `.app`, `.sidebar` → `.app__nav`,
`.top-bar` → `.app__top`, `.content` → `.app__content`, `.nav-link` →
`.nav-item`, `.nav-section__label` → `.nav-group__label`, `.user-button` →
`.user-btn`, `.sidebar-brand__*` → `.brand__*`. Pull `Shell.dc.html` to diff
against.

**5+. One tool per PR**, each pulling its archetype CSS from the design project
and deleting its slice of `tools.css`. Suggested order — cheapest proof first,
then best leverage, then the hard ones:

| # | Surface | Archetype | Why here |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 5 | Piper, Compare | 11 (diff) | Small scoped CSS; proves the loop end to end |
| 6 | Templates, Cookbook, Projects, Releases, Pipelines browsers | 2 (list) | One archetype, five pages — the biggest `tools.css` deletion |
| 7 | New Workspace / New Extension | 5 (generator) | The signature screen; live preview + sticky pane |
| 8 | Admin CRUD + audit history | 6 | `AuditHistoryPanel`, `AuditDiffViewer`, the `.diff` block |
| 9 | Administration / site-admin settings | 7 | Sub-nav header tabs; many small forms |
| 10 | Admin + site-admin dashboards | 4 | Where `.cue` tiles would land |
| 11 | Auth pages | auth card | Self-contained, no shell; `auth.css` is nearly clean already |
| 12 | Docs, MCP setup, 404/500 | 12-14 | Light surfaces, mostly prose |
| 13 | Translator | 9 (grid, compact) | Power tool; `.tgrid` is a full rewrite of the grid |
| 14 | Object Explorer | 10 (source viewer, compact) | Largest surface; three panes, tabs, refs, resizers |

Every user-facing PR still owes the **UX definition of done** checklist from
CLAUDE.md and a `design-review` pass — a restyle is exactly when jargon and bad
empty states survive unnoticed, because the page "looks finished".
