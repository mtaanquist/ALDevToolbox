# TOML overhaul — continuation notes (Issue #54)

A working doc for the **next** session to pick up the unified-extensions work
where this one left off. The spec for the data model itself is in
`unified-extensions.md`; this file is the implementation-state companion.

**Branch:** `claude/issue-54-R6lFE`
**PR:** [#56](https://github.com/mtaanquist/ALDevToolbox/pull/56)
**Last commit on branch:** see `git log claude/issue-54-R6lFE`

## Acceptance-criteria status

From the issue body:

| Criterion | Status |
|---|---|
| EF migration applies cleanly forward; CI green | done |
| New tests for recursive folder tree, modules-as-extension-template clone, deps by stable id, `AffixType.None` | done |
| Migration data-shape rewrite covered by a test | done — see `ALDevToolbox.Tests/Migrations/UnifyExtensionsDataMigrationTests.cs`. The migration's PL/pgSQL block is now exposed as `UnifyExtensions.DataRewriteSql` so the test can replay it verbatim against an in-test pre-unified fixture. |
| Real customer-style TOML round-trips through mapper **and generates a ZIP** | done — see `ALDevToolbox.Tests/Generation/WorkspaceEndToEndTests.cs`. Customer-style TOML parses through `TemplateTomlMapper.FromToml`, persists via `TemplateService.CreateAsync(TemplateAuthoring)`, generates via `GenerationService.GenerateWorkspaceAsync`. The test pins per-extension `app.json` layout, idRange allocation across all three layers, all three dependency reference shapes (`extension =`, `module =`, literal), and module-clone implicit deps on required template extensions. |
| Three impacted design docs rewritten with no stale references | done — `domain-model.md`, `generation-engine.md`, and `templates-and-seeding.md` rewritten cover-to-cover for the unified-extensions shape. Issue #54 transition banners removed; the bodies now describe the new tables, the per-extension walk, and the `[[extensions]]` TOML schema as the canonical shape. |
| CLAUDE.md fences still hold | yes — Postgres-as-source-of-truth, multi-tenant, synchronous generation, no client framework all intact |

## What's in the branch already

### Schema + data layer
- New entities: `WorkspaceExtension`, `WorkspaceExtensionFolder` (self-FK,
  recursive), `WorkspaceExtensionFile`, `WorkspaceExtensionDependency` (three-way
  ref with a CHECK constraint), `ModuleExtensionFolder`, `ModuleExtensionFile`,
  `AffixType` enum. Pre-unified `TemplateFolder` / `TemplateFile` /
  `TemplateModuleFolder` / `TemplateModuleFile` are gone.
- `RuntimeTemplate` shed `Folders` / `ModuleFolders` / `DefaultApplication` /
  `DefaultPlatform`; gained `WorkspaceExtensions`. `Module` gained
  `ExtensionFolders`. `TemplateDefaults` gained `Application` / `Platform` /
  `ExtensionPrefix` / `Affix` / `AffixType`. `ProjectPlan` gained
  `ExtensionPrefix` + `SelectedExtensionPaths`; lost `IncludeForNav`.
- `AppDbContext` configures the six new tables, including the partial unique
  indexes (`(parent_folder_id, path) WHERE parent_folder_id IS NOT NULL` and
  `(workspace_extension_id, path) WHERE parent_folder_id IS NULL`) and the
  dependency CHECK constraint (added in raw SQL in the migration since EF
  doesn't have a fluent API for it).
- Migration `20260514000000_UnifyExtensions`: forward-only (`Down` throws),
  data-rewrites pre-unified rows into the new shape, folds
  `default_application` / `default_platform` into `defaults_json`, rewrites
  `{{prefix}}` / `{{suffix}}` → `{{affix}}` across all content columns, and
  stamps `defaults.affix` / `defaults.affixType` from each template's existing
  `AppSourceCop.mandatoryPrefix`. PL/pgSQL block in `Up()`.

### Algorithm layer
- `TemplateTomlMapper` rewritten around `[[extensions]]` + recursive
  `[[extensions.folders.folders]]` + `[[extensions.dependencies]]` +
  `[[template.default_modules]]`. Hand-emits the recursive folder blocks
  because Tomlyn's reflection serialiser produces inline arrays.
- `GenerationService` rewritten as a per-extension walk: required template
  extensions → user-selected optionals → one cloned extension per selected
  module. ID-range allocation has three layers (explicit > module size >
  template auto). Mustache table is `{{name}}`, `{{workspaceName}}`,
  `{{shortName}}`, `{{moduleName}}`, `{{publisher}}`, `{{extension_prefix}}`,
  `{{affix}}`, `{{namespace}}`, `{{guid}}` (drops `{{prefix}}` / `{{suffix}}`).
  Overlapping ranges raise `PlanValidationException`.

### Service writes
- `TemplateService.CreateAsync(TemplateAuthoring)` /
  `UpdateAsync(int, TemplateAuthoring)` persist the full graph. Update is
  wipe-and-rebuild for the extension tree; default-modules join row reconciles
  by `ModuleId` (the natural identity), **not** by list position, because
  position-based mutation would trip the `(template_id, module_id)` unique
  index on a swap (EF detects the cycle and refuses). Validator emits
  field-keyed errors for path segment rules, sibling uniqueness, dependency
  one-of, and intra-template extension resolution.
- Legacy `TemplateInput` overloads kept as throwing stubs so the unmigrated
  structured admin form compiles; its catch block surfaces a friendly "use
  the TOML tab" nudge.
- `TemplateImportService` clones `WorkspaceExtension` + its recursive folder/
  file/dep tree, and `EnsureModuleAsync` clones the module's
  `ModuleExtensionFolders` tree. Recursive folder reads use a flat-query +
  client-side reassembly pattern (see below).

### Surfaces wired
- Admin TOML editor save path: `AdminTemplateEdit.SaveTomlAsync` calls
  `TemplateService.CreateAsync(TemplateAuthoring)` / `UpdateAsync` for real.
  Round-trips back through `ToToml` on success.
- New Workspace form: `ExtensionPrefix` input (pre-fills from
  `defaults.extension_prefix`), "Additional extensions" checkbox list for
  optional template-declared extensions, `IncludeForNav` removed.

### Tests in place
- `Domain.Tests.Extensions.UnifiedExtensionsShapeTests` — pins the entity
  shape (recursive folder tree, three-way dep, `AffixType.None`, module
  folder mirror).
- `Generation.WorkspaceGenerationTests` — 13 end-to-end tests covering the
  per-extension walk, module-clone implicit-Core-dep, recursive folder
  layout, example filtering, `{{affix}}` + `{{extension_prefix}}`
  substitution, extension/literal/module dependency resolution, id-range
  override + auto-allocate + module-size override, overlap detection.
- `Toml.TemplateTomlMapperRoundTripTests` — 11 round-trip tests covering
  metadata, defaults, ordered required/optional extensions, recursive
  folder tree with files at any depth, `IsExample`, all three dep
  reference shapes, default modules, id-range overrides, bare runtime
  values, BlankToml starter.
- `Toml.TemplateTomlMapperToleranceTests` — three tests pinning the
  customer-style template (Core + Hotfix + module-cloned Document Capture
  with recursive folder trees and a module-key dep) parses cleanly.
- `Templates.TemplateImportServiceTests` — five tests covering end-to-end
  cross-org clone, key-clash refusal, system-org refusal, local module
  reuse, ListSystemTemplates marking already-imported.
- `Templates.TemplateServiceWriteSideTests` (in the
  `TemplateServiceReconciliationTests.cs` file) — seven tests covering
  Create persistence, Update cascade rebuild, default-modules PK stability
  on swap, three validator paths, legacy-overload throws.
- Two new generator/mapper tests files coexist with three legacy `#if false`
  fenced test files (see "Pure cleanup" below).

## What's left

The two AC-critical bullets and the design-doc rewrite landed in the
continuation session. What remains splits into **user-facing gaps that
block a complete end-to-end flow** and **internal cleanup**.

### User-facing gaps (block the complete end-to-end flow)

#### 1. ~~Structured admin folder/file editor~~ — done

~~`Components/Pages/Admin/AdminTemplateEdit.razor` was rewritten around the
unified-extensions shape. `FormState` is gone; the page now binds
against `TemplateFormState` (in `Components/Shared/TemplateFormModels.cs`)
which mirrors `TemplateAuthoring` 1:1 — `Extensions` with per-extension
metadata + dependencies + a recursive folder tree. Saving from the
structured form calls `TemplateService.CreateAsync(TemplateAuthoring)` /
`UpdateAsync(int, TemplateAuthoring)` directly; the legacy `TemplateInput`
record and its throwing overloads were deleted.~~

~~Authoring the recursive tree is handled by
`Components/Shared/RecursiveFolderEditor.razor` — a self-recursive
component that lets admins add / remove / nest folders and attach files
at any depth, with up/down reordering at every level. The TOML pane
still works exactly as before; the Form ↔ TOML round-trip is now lossless
for everything except the `deprecated` flag (which only lives on the form
side, as it always did).~~

~~Hydration: `TemplateService.GetAuthoringByKeyAsync` loads an existing
template into the `TemplateAuthoring` shape via flat queries + client-side
parent/child reassembly (the same pattern `GenerationService` and
`TemplateImportService` use). The edit-page load path goes through this
one method for both the form and the TOML editor.~~ Landed on
`claude/toml-overhaul-tasks-IVvii` in commit `aabbfca` (PR #57).

#### 2. ~~Recursive preview in the UI~~ — done

~~Currently stubbed.~~ Landed: every preview surface walks the real
per-extension folder tree.

- `Components/Pages/TemplateDetail.razor` — renders a `FolderTreePreview`
  built from each required `WorkspaceExtension`'s recursive folder tree,
  examples on.
- `Components/Pages/NewWorkspace.razor` — emits one extension folder per
  required template extension, one per ticked optional, and one per
  selected module (cloned from `Module.ExtensionFolders`). The stat card
  counts those instead of the old "Core + selected modules" approximation.
- `Components/Pages/NewExtension.razor` — standalone preview walks the
  picked template's first required extension (the scaffold the generator
  uses); sibling-workspace preview renders required template extensions +
  imported module trees + the new extension tagged `IsNew`.

All three share `Components/Shared/ExtensionPreviewBuilder` — recursive
folder walk, example filtering, `.gitkeep` for empty leaves, and the
libs/permissionsets/Translations fallback. Pinned by
`ALDevToolbox.Tests/Extensions/ExtensionPreviewBuilderTests.cs`.

Folder trees aren't pulled by the default `GetTemplatesAsync` /
`GetModulesAsync` / `GetByKeyAsync` reads; the preview pages call
`TemplateService.HydrateExtensionFolderTreeAsync` /
`HydrateModuleExtensionFolderTreeAsync` after the initial load so the
recursive tree is in memory before the preview renders.

#### 3. Migration data-loss advisory (release note, not code)

The migration is forward-only and **lossy on the module side**. The
pre-unified `template_module_folders` rows were shared per-template across
every module the template default-selects; the rewrite fans them out onto
every module in each template's `default_modules` list. Modules that
aren't in any default list end up with empty folder trees.

For real deployments upgrading from a pre-unified DB: an admin needs to
look over the cloned module content after the migration runs and either
accept it or edit/empty modules that don't actually need that scaffolding.
Not code work — release-note / upgrade-guide work. Don't ship the
migration to production without flagging this.

### Internal cleanup (doesn't affect users)

#### 4. ~~Test cleanup: retire the `#if false` files~~ — done

The three `#if false` Generation/Toml files were deleted outright
(`MustacheSubstitutionTests`, `IdRangeAllocationTests`,
`TemplateTomlMapperTests`); their coverage already lives in
`WorkspaceGenerationTests`, `TemplateTomlMapperRoundTripTests`, and
`TemplateTomlMapperToleranceTests`. The two missing
`AuditInterceptorTests` got rewritten against the unified-extensions
types (`Extension_snapshot_inlines_folders`,
`Workspace_extension_file_snapshot_hashes_content`).

## Gotchas worth knowing

These bit me during the implementation; flagging so the next session
doesn't relearn them.

### `WorkspaceExtensionId` / `ModuleId` denormalisation needs propagation

The `workspace_extension_folders` and `module_extension_folders` tables
carry the parent extension / module id on every row (denormalised — see
`unified-extensions.md`'s "Schema changes" section for the reasoning).
EF wires the top-level folder's FK automatically via the
`WorkspaceExtension.Folders` collection navigation, but **nested folders
only have a parent navigation** — EF doesn't propagate the
extension/module id past the first hop.

The fix is in `AppDbContext.SaveChanges` / `SaveChangesAsync`: a hook
walks the parent chain of every added/modified folder and copies the
root's nav reference down before the save runs. See
`AppDbContext.PropagateExtensionFolderIds`.

### Default-modules reconciler can't mutate `ModuleId` in place

The `(runtime_template_id, module_id)` unique index on
`runtime_template_default_modules` blocks any update batch where two
rows swap their `module_id` values. EF detects the cycle and throws
`Unable to save changes because a circular dependency was detected`.

The fix is to match existing rows by `ModuleId` (the natural identity),
not by list position. See `TemplateService.ReconcileDefaultModules`.
Reorders rewrite the non-unique `Ordering` column; `ModuleId` stays put
on each row.

### EF doesn't recurse on `Include`; use flat queries + client-side reassembly

Loading a recursive folder tree via `Include(t => t.WorkspaceExtensions)
.ThenInclude(e => e.Folders).ThenInclude(f => f.Folders)` only goes two
levels deep. The pattern that works:

1. Single flat query for all folders under the relevant extensions
   (filter by `WorkspaceExtensionId IN (...)`).
2. Single flat query for all files under those folders.
3. Client-side: dictionary by `Id`, attach each folder to its parent's
   `Folders` collection (or the extension's `Folders` if root), attach
   each file to its folder's `Files` collection.

Both `GenerationService.AssembleFolderTree` and
`TemplateImportService.HydrateExtensionTreeAsync` use this pattern.
With `AsNoTracking()`, EF's change-tracker fixup doesn't run, so the
client-side reassembly is mandatory there.

### Tomlyn silently drops unknown keys

The `TemplateSeed` POCO doesn't have to model every possible TOML key —
Tomlyn's `TomlSerializer.Deserialize` with the System.Text.Json-style API
ignores unknown properties by default. The customer template's
pre-unified leftovers (`default_application` at `[template]` level, the
`[[defaults.modules]]` array, the `[workspace]` block) drop without
complaint. Useful for ingest tolerance; not something to rely on for
*forward* validation (i.e. don't expect Tomlyn to flag typos).

### TemplateAuthoring vs TemplateInput

The form-binding `TemplateInput` record (legacy structured form) and the
new `TemplateAuthoring` record (TOML editor output) are deliberately
separate types. Both `TemplateService.CreateAsync` / `UpdateAsync` have
two overloads — one per type. The `TemplateInput` overloads throw
`NotImplementedException` until the structured form editor is rewritten.

When the structured editor lands (item 1 in "User-facing gaps"), the
cleanest move is to delete `TemplateInput` and its overloads, then route
the form's `ToInput()` directly to `TemplateAuthoring`.

## How to pick up

1. `git checkout claude/issue-54-R6lFE && git pull`
2. Read `.design/unified-extensions.md` for the spec.
3. Read this file for the implementation state.
4. `dotnet test` to confirm CI-green baseline locally.
5. Pick an item from "What's left". The "user-facing gaps" section
   blocks a complete end-to-end flow; item 1 (structured editor) is its
   own PR's worth of work, item 2 (preview) is ~half a day, item 3
   (migration advisory) is release-note work. The "internal cleanup"
   section doesn't affect users.
6. Watch CI on PR #56 via the `subscribe_pr_activity` MCP tool.
