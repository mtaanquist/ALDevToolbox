# MCP OAuth — design

## Why

Claude.ai's directory and custom-connector flow does **not** accept a
user-pasted bearer token. From [Anthropic's connector docs][anthropic-auth]:

> User-pasted bearer tokens (`static_bearer`) are not yet supported.

The two out-of-the-box methods Claude does support are **DCR** (Dynamic
Client Registration, RFC 7591) and **CIMD** (Client ID Metadata Document).
Anything else (`oauth_anthropic_creds`, `custom_connection`) requires
emailing `mcp-review@anthropic.com` and an Anthropic-side review.

Today AL Dev Toolbox gates `/mcp` with a single bearer flavour: the
PAT (`aldt_pat_…`) handler in
`Services/Account/PatAuthenticationHandler.cs`. That works for Claude
Desktop, Cursor, Copilot agent mode, and Claude Code, all of which let you
paste the token into a config file. It does not work for Claude on the web
or on mobile. To make those clients addable as a Claude custom connector,
we ship an OAuth 2.1 authorization server alongside the PAT path.

PAT stays. OAuth is added. The MCP endpoint accepts either.

## Auth modes

| Mode  | What Claude does                                              | When                                                                 |
|-------|---------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| PAT   | Reads `Authorization: Bearer aldt_pat_…` from its config file | Desktop apps, CLI tools, scripts                                     |
| OAuth | DCR-registers itself as a public client, runs the auth-code   | claude.ai, Claude mobile, Cowork — the hosted Claude surfaces        |
| OAuth | Identifies itself with a CIMD URL                             | Claude prefers this when the AS metadata advertises CIMD support     |

Claude picks CIMD over DCR only when the AS metadata advertises **both**
`client_id_metadata_document_supported: true` **and** `"none"` in
`token_endpoint_auth_methods_supported`. Otherwise it falls back to DCR.
ALDevToolbox advertises both, so high-traffic CIMD clients avoid the per-
connection DCR registration.

`client_credentials` is **not** supported. The MCP authorization spec
forbids pure machine-to-machine grants — every connection needs user
consent.

## Persistence

Five tables, all snake_case:

| Table                | Owner       | Notes                                                                 |
|----------------------|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `oauth_applications` | OpenIddict  | DCR-registered & CIMD-resolved clients. Org attribution in `properties`. |
| `oauth_authorizations` | OpenIddict | Short-lived grant tickets.                                            |
| `oauth_scopes`       | OpenIddict  | Registered scope catalogue.                                           |
| `oauth_tokens`       | OpenIddict  | Access + refresh tokens. Reference + payload columns are DP-wrapped.  |
| `oauth_consents`     | ALDevToolbox | One row per (user, client, org). Drives the consent auto-skip + revoke. |

The four OpenIddict tables sit **outside** the multi-tenant query filter
because pre-auth flows (`/oauth/token`, `/oauth/register`) must read them
before any `IOrganizationContext` is mounted. Org attribution lives in
OpenIddict's free-form `properties` JSON column, stamped during the
consent step. `oauth_consents` is inside the filter — it's a normal
per-org table.

## Key ring

Two layers, both pinned to the `app-keys` volume:

1. **Token format wrapping** uses ASP.NET Core's existing Data Protection
   key ring (`o.UseDataProtection()`). Losing `app-keys` already
   invalidates auth cookies and the `system_settings` SMTP password;
   OAuth tokens sharing its fate isn't a new failure mode.
2. **OpenIddict signing + encryption keys** for the JWKS endpoint and the
   internal token-format fallback. `UseDataProtection()` doesn't supply
   these — they're a separate piece of key material. Persisted by
   `Services/OAuth/OAuthKeyMaterial.cs` as two PKCS#1 DER files under
   the same directory the Data Protection ring uses
   (`OAUTH_KEY_DIR` overrides; falls back to `DATA_PROTECTION_KEY_DIR`,
   then `/var/lib/aldevtoolbox/dp-keys`). File mode tightened to 0600
   on Unix; threat model matches the existing DP keys (anyone who can
   read the volume can already read the cookie keys and the SMTP
   password).

   On first start a fresh 2048-bit RSA pair is generated for each
   purpose and written. Subsequent starts load the same bytes. A
   container restart no longer invalidates every issued access +
   refresh token, so Claude doesn't need to re-consent on every
   redeploy — which was the original "deferred risk" from the first
   OAuth PR.

   If the directory isn't writable we fall back to in-memory keys with
   a logged warning. That's a strict superset of the prior behaviour
   (which was always ephemeral) — the only difference is the warning.

## Why OpenIddict and not hand-rolled

Hand-rolling an OAuth 2.1 authorization server is roughly 1000–1500 lines
of crypto + spec correctness we'd own forever. OpenIddict is BSD-licensed,
ships `net10.0` targets in v7.5.0, and already implements PKCE S256, RFC
6749 error codes, refresh-token rotation, and discovery metadata. The
remaining pieces — DCR endpoint, AS metadata customisation, resource
metadata, consent UI — are small enough to live in `OAuthEndpoints.cs`
plus one Razor page.

## DCR endpoint

OpenIddict 7.5.0's server builder does **not** expose a first-class
registration endpoint. We hand-roll it as a minimal API at
`POST /oauth/register` and write through `IOpenIddictApplicationManager`.
Anonymous (Claude registers without a user); rejects non-https
`redirect_uris` except for loopback (Claude Code uses
`http://127.0.0.1:<port>/callback`); stamps registration provenance
("dcr") into the application's `properties` JSON.

The discovery metadata customisation in `Program.cs` adds
`registration_endpoint` to the AS metadata so Claude finds it.

## CIMD resolver

Claude's hosted surfaces (claude.ai, mobile, Cowork) skip DCR entirely and
identify themselves with an HTTPS URL as their `client_id` — for example
`https://claude.ai/oauth/mcp-oauth-client-metadata`. The URL is the
identity; the JSON document at that URL is the client's metadata.

`Services/OAuth/CimdClientResolver.cs` is an
`IOpenIddictServerHandler<ValidateAuthorizationRequestContext>` registered
with `int.MinValue + 100_000` so it runs ahead of every built-in
OpenIddict validator. When `client_id` is an HTTPS URL with no matching
`oauth_applications` row, the resolver:

1. Fetches the URL with a 5 s timeout and a 64 KB body cap.
2. Validates the document's `client_id` self-reference, `redirect_uris`,
   and `token_endpoint_auth_method=none`.
3. Creates a public PKCE client via `IOpenIddictApplicationManager` with
   `registration_source: "cimd"` stamped into `properties` JSON.

Subsequent connections from the same URL skip the fetch — the row exists
and OpenIddict's standard validator finds it directly. Resolver failures
reject the authorise request with RFC 6749 `invalid_client`, which Claude
surfaces with the metadata-fetch error rather than a generic timeout.

Without the resolver, OpenIddict rejects every CIMD client with
`ID2052: The specified 'client_id' is invalid` — see
<https://documentation.openiddict.com/errors/ID2052>.

## Resource indicators (RFC 8707)

The MCP 2025-11-25 spec requires clients to include a `resource=<canonical
URL>` parameter on every authorise + token request (RFC 8707), and Claude's
hosted surfaces send `resource=https://<host>/mcp` accordingly. OpenIddict
7.5's stock `ValidateResources` handler compares that value against the
in-memory `OpenIddictServerOptions.Resources` set populated at startup via
`o.RegisterResources(...)`, and rejects unrecognised values with `ID2190
invalid_target`.

The public host isn't known when the host builds (deployments use the
request's `X-Forwarded-*` headers as the source of truth and there is no
`PublicUrl` configuration). Two attempts to mutate the set on the fly from
a pre-validator event handler — first by upserting the `mcp` scope row's
`Resources` column (#191), then by adding to `Options.Resources` directly
(#192) — failed to take effect for reasons we couldn't diagnose without
deeper instrumentation. Rather than pile on more workarounds, we set
`o.DisableResourceValidation()` and accept the resource as-is.

This is safe in our threat model: ALDevToolbox only ever issues tokens for
the `/mcp` resource, the audience is still recorded on the issued token,
and `Services/OAuth/McpBearerPolicy.cs` enforces the audience on every
incoming `/mcp` request. The validator was defence-in-depth for servers
fronting multiple resources, which we are not.

Revisit when OpenIddict adds native DCR / CIMD support
(openiddict/openiddict-core#2404, targeted at 7.6.0) — that release will
likely surface a more idiomatic way to register resources from a CIMD
application descriptor, at which point the dynamic-add approach we
abandoned should become viable.

## Consent screen

`Components/Pages/AccountSecurity/OAuthConsent.razor` — static SSR Razor
page at `GET /oauth/consent`, gated by `[Authorize]` on the cookie
scheme. The page lives at `/oauth/consent` (not `/oauth/authorize`)
because Blazor's `@page` directive registers a route with no HTTP-method
constraint, so co-locating the page and the consent-POST handler at the
same URL trips `EndpointAmbiguityTests`. Instead, the OpenIddict-validated
`GET /oauth/authorize` is a thin redirect endpoint (`MapAuthorizeGet`)
that forwards every query parameter verbatim to `/oauth/consent`.

The consent page reads its OAuth parameters from the query string
(since OpenIddict middleware doesn't run on `/oauth/consent`) and
re-emits them as hidden inputs on a form that POSTs to `/oauth/authorize`.
OpenIddict's middleware runs on the POST, validates the form body as an
authorization request, and passes through to `MapAuthorizeComplete`,
which stamps an `oauth_consents` row and calls `SignIn(...)`. OpenIddict
turns the SignIn into the auth-code redirect.

Auto-skip when a matching consent row already covers the requested
scopes is recorded but the user still clicks Allow — a security
trade-off in favour of the user always seeing what they're approving.
A v2 could shorten this to a silent auto-submit.

## Claim bridge

`Services/OAuth/OAuthClaimsTransformer.cs` runs after OpenIddict
validation succeeds and stamps the ALDevToolbox claim names
(`HttpOrganizationContext.UserIdClaim` / `OrganizationIdClaim` / etc.)
on the principal. The MCP endpoint (and every other consumer of
`IOrganizationContext`) is then identical whether the bearer was a PAT
or an OAuth access token.

The transformer re-checks the user's status against the live row —
deactivating a user kills their OAuth tokens on the next request.

## Configuration

Everything has a sensible default; the operator knobs are:

| Key                                  | Default                | Purpose                                                    |
|--------------------------------------|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| `OAuth:Issuer`                       | request-derived        | Override when the public URL differs from `Request.Host`.  |
| `OAuth:AccessTokenLifetimeMinutes`   | 60                     | Refresh fires ~5 min before expiry.                        |
| `OAuth:RefreshTokenLifetimeDays`     | 30                     | Rolling — each refresh extends the window.                 |

DCR + CIMD kill-switches will land alongside the SiteAdmin runtime toggle
for MCP in a follow-up — same shape as `system_settings.mcp_enabled`.

## Risks

- **Reverse-proxy `X-Forwarded-Proto` missing in prod** → OpenIddict
  emits `http://` as the issuer → Claude rejects discovery. Add a
  startup self-check that logs a hard error when the resolved issuer is
  plain `http://` outside `Development`. (Open.)
- **CIMD open-client surface** — anyone with a public JSON metadata
  document can act as a client. The plan reserves a
  `OAuth:CimdAllowedHosts` allow-list; default is permissive to match
  Claude's expected behaviour. (Open.)
- **Multi-org users** — `User.OrganizationId` is scalar today, so the
  consent screen doesn't need an org selector. When multi-org lands, the
  consent page must show the chosen org name prominently, bind the
  consent row to it, and re-prompt when the user picks a different org.
- **Refresh-token reuse detection** — OpenIddict raises an event when a
  rotated refresh token is replayed. Wire that event to revoke the
  entire grant + audit `OAuthTokenReuseDetected`. (Open.)
