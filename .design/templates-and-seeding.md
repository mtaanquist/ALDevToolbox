# Templates and seeding

This document covers where templates live, the TOML schema admins author against, and the import-from-system-org flow. The data-model spec lives in `domain-model.md`; the unified-extensions data shape (Issue #54) is documented in `unified-extensions.md`.

## Where templates live

**Persistence:** in the PostgreSQL database. Templates, modules, and catalogue entries are stored as rows in the tables described in `domain-model.md`. The DB is the source of truth at runtime — every read on the user-facing flows hits these tables.

**Authoring surfaces:** two equal options, both writing through the same `TemplateAuthoring` validation pipeline into the DB.

1. **The structured admin form.** Field-by-field editing on `/admin/templates/{key}`. Best for incremental tweaks, single-flag changes, and folder reordering.
2. **TOML.** A textarea on the same admin page (toggle in the header) that round-trips a `template.toml` document. Best for authoring a new template from scratch, bulk folder edits, and copy-pasting a template from one environment to another. New templates default to TOML mode because that's the workflow this is optimised for.

**Bootstrap:** the singleton **system organisation** is the canonical source other orgs fork from. The Default org carries `organizations.is_system = true` (stamped by migration `20260513000000_MoveSeedToSystemOrg`); a partial unique index refuses a second system org per deployment. SiteAdmins author templates, modules and application versions there via the regular `/admin/templates*` pages — the system org is otherwise a normal org from the data model's point of view.

Every other organisation starts **empty**. New-org signup (auto-approved or admin-approved) no longer triggers any seed step; the admin lands on `/admin/templates` with two ways to populate it:

1. **Import from site.** `/admin/templates` renders a "From the site catalogue" section listing the system org's published templates. Clicking **Import** copies the chosen template (plus its referenced modules and default application version) into the local org via `TemplateImportService.ImportTemplateAsync`. Imports are one-way clones — once a template is in the local org, system-side edits no longer propagate.
2. **Author from scratch.** The structured form and TOML editor work exactly as before; the org simply doesn't have any starting content until the admin adds some.

The retired on-disk `Templates.seed/` directory is gone, along with `SeedService`. The `OrganizationConfigService.PopulateDefaultsAsync` pipeline and the disk-default logo are also gone — new orgs start with no logo and no settings row; admins fill them in via `/admin/configuration`.

This split exists so:
- The deployment has exactly one canonical catalogue that SiteAdmins curate at runtime, instead of a per-PR file-system bootstrap.
- New orgs come up empty and pull only the templates they care about, rather than the entire historical seed snapshot.
- Day-to-day edits — and authoring entire new templates — don't require a PR + redeploy.
- Admins comfortable with TOML can stay in TOML; admins who prefer forms can stay in forms.

## Import strategy

`TemplateImportService.ImportTemplateAsync(systemTemplateId)` clones one template into the acting organisation. Pseudocode:

```
TemplateImportService.ImportTemplateAsync(systemTemplateId):
    require an authenticated org context
    refuse if the acting org IS the system org (would import from itself)
    resolve the system org via IsSystem = true (bypassing query filters)
    load the source template with its WorkspaceExtension graph:
      - extensions ordered by Ordering
      - the recursive workspace_extension_folders tree (loaded via a flat
        query and reassembled client-side — EF's Include doesn't recurse)
      - workspace_extension_files attached to each folder at its depth
      - workspace_extension_dependencies per extension
      - default modules + their dependencies
      - default application version
    refuse if the local org already has a template with the same key
    for each referenced Module:
        reuse the local module that shares the key, otherwise clone it
        (with its module_dependencies AND its recursive
        module_extension_folders / module_extension_files tree) into the
        local org
    for the default application version:
        reuse the local row that shares the key, otherwise clone it
    insert a fresh runtime_template row (organization_id = acting org)
        plus the cloned WorkspaceExtension graph
    return the new template
```

The full graph commits in a single `SaveChangesAsync`. The audit interceptor records every insert, so the importing org's audit log carries the operation in full.

`ListSystemTemplatesAsync()` is the read-side counterpart — it returns the system org's active templates with an `AlreadyImported` flag so the UI can render "Already imported" instead of an Import button on rows the local org already has.

Idempotency is per-template-key per-org: a second click on the same row throws `PlanValidationException("Key", …)` rather than silently overwriting.

## Tomlyn usage

Tomlyn deserialises directly into POCOs. `Domain/Seed/` carries the mirrored types used by the admin TOML editor and the export pipeline (it is no longer wired to any on-disk bootstrap):

```csharp
class TemplateSeed {
    public TemplateMetaSeed Template { get; set; }
    public DefaultsSeed Defaults { get; set; }
    public AppSourceCopSeed AppSourceCop { get; set; }
    public List<ExtensionSeed> Extensions { get; set; }  // [[extensions]]
}
class ExtensionSeed {
    public string Path { get; set; }                     // stable identifier
    public string Name { get; set; }                     // mustache name template
    public bool Required { get; set; } = true;
    public string? Application { get; set; }             // per-extension override
    public string? Runtime { get; set; }                 // per-extension override
    public int? IdRangeFrom { get; set; }                // explicit override
    public int? IdRangeTo { get; set; }
    public List<FolderSeed> Folders { get; set; } = new();
    public List<DependencySeed> Dependencies { get; set; } = new();
}
class FolderSeed {
    public string Path { get; set; }                     // single segment
    public List<FolderSeed> Folders { get; set; } = new();   // recursive
    public List<FolderFileSeed> Files { get; set; } = new(); // attached at this depth
}
class FolderFileSeed {
    public string Path { get; set; }
    public string Content { get; set; }                  // mustache-substituted at generation time
    public bool IsExample { get; set; }
}
class DependencySeed {
    public string? Extension { get; set; }               // one of these
    public string? Module { get; set; }
    public string? Id { get; set; }
    public string? Name { get; set; }
    public string? Publisher { get; set; }
    public string? Version { get; set; }
}
```

`TemplateTomlMapper.FromToml(text, deprecated)` does the deserialisation and emits a `TemplateAuthoring` ready for `TemplateService.CreateAsync` / `UpdateAsync`. The `defaults_json` and `app_source_cop_json` columns are populated by re-serialising the relevant sub-objects to JSON.

## Template TOML schema

A `template.toml` document — pasted into the admin TOML editor or produced by the export pipeline — follows the **unified-extensions** shape:

```toml
# Required: template metadata
[template]
key = "runtime-15"
runtime = "15"
name = "Runtime 15+"
description = "Namespace folders, AppSource-ready"
core_id_range_from = 90000
core_id_range_to = 90999
module_id_range_start = 91000
module_id_range_size = 200
is_default = false

# Optional: default-selected catalogue modules. End-users can still opt out of
# any entry; this only seeds the initial selection on the New Workspace form.
# Unknown keys drop with a warning rather than failing the import.
[[template.default_modules]]
key = "document-capture"

# Required: defaults merged into every generated app.json. The form pre-fills
# from these, the user edits, the final values flow into per-extension app.json.
[defaults]
publisher = "Consortio IT"
target = "Cloud"
application = "27.0.0.0"        # pre-fill; user can override on New Workspace
platform = "1.0.0.0"            # pre-fill; user can override on New Workspace
extension_prefix = "ACME"       # pre-fill; user can override on New Workspace
url = "https://www.consortio.dk/"
logo = "../.assets/images/logo.png"
features = ["TranslationFile", "NoImplicitWith"]
supportedLocales = ["en-US", "da-DK"]
affix = "ACME"
affixType = "Prefix"            # "None" | "Prefix" | "Suffix"

[defaults.resourceExposurePolicy]
allowDebugging = true
allowDownloadingSource = false
includeSourceInSymbolFile = true

# Required: AppSourceCop.json contents (merged into every extension's
# AppSourceCop.json — mustache substitution runs at generation time).
[appSourceCop]
mandatoryPrefix = "CONIT"
supportedCountries = ["US", "DK"]

# Required: at least one [[extensions]] entry. Display order is array order;
# required = true entries always emit, required = false entries surface as
# checkboxes on the New Workspace form.

[[extensions]]
path = "Core"                   # stable identifier (folder name in ZIP, dep ref target)
name = "{{extension_prefix}} Core"
required = true
# id_range_from / id_range_to optional — auto-allocate from the template ranges
# when omitted (see generation-engine.md "ID range allocation").

# Folders nest: each [[extensions.folders]] is a top-level folder under the
# extension; [[extensions.folders.folders]] are children, recursively. Files
# attach at any depth via [[extensions.folders.files]] / nested .files blocks.
[[extensions.folders]]
path = "src"

[[extensions.folders.folders]]
path = "codeunits"

[[extensions.folders.folders.files]]
path = "AppInstall.Codeunit.al"
content = """
namespace {{namespace}};

codeunit 90100 "{{affix}} App Install"
{
    Subtype = Install;
}
"""

[[extensions.folders.folders.files]]
path = "Example.Codeunit.al"
content = """codeunit 90101 \"{{affix}} Example\" { }"""
is_example = true              # only emitted when plan.IncludeExamples is true

# A second required extension — depending on Core by stable path.
[[extensions]]
path = "Hotfix"
name = "{{extension_prefix}} Hotfix"
required = true
application = "27.0.0.0"        # per-extension override (optional)
runtime = "15"                  # per-extension override (optional)

[[extensions.dependencies]]
extension = "Core"              # refs another [[extensions]] entry by `path`

[[extensions.folders]]
path = "src"

# An optional extension — admins flip required = false to surface it as a
# checkbox on New Workspace. Hidden until ticked.
[[extensions]]
path = "Translations"
name = "{{extension_prefix}} Translations"
required = false
```

Notes:

- **`path` is the stable identifier** of an extension. `name` is display-only (mustache-substituted), `path` is the immutable reference target for dependencies.
- **`required` defaults to true.** Template-declared extensions are always emitted unless explicitly marked optional. Optional extensions surface as checkboxes on New Workspace.
- **Folders are a recursive tree, not flat paths.** Each `path` is a single segment; nesting is `[[extensions.folders.folders]]`. Files attach at any depth via `[[extensions.folders.files]]` / `[[extensions.folders.folders.files]]` / etc.
- **No `[[module_folders]]`** at the template level. Modules carry their own folder/file trees on the module entity itself (see "Module TOML schema" below).
- **`application` and `runtime`** are template-wide by default (from `[defaults]`), override-able per extension. Most workspaces use one version; the override unblocks mixed-version edge cases.

## Module TOML schema

Each module's TOML document. Modules now carry their own folder/file tree alongside their dependencies — when a module is selected on New Workspace, its folder tree clones into the workspace as one cloned extension at generation time.

```toml
[module]
key = "document-capture"
name = "Document Capture"
id_range_size = 200             # optional; null/missing = use template default

[[module.dependencies]]
dep_id = "4b915d7e-c02a-435f-85ab-649086c1e002"
dep_name = "Continia Core"
dep_publisher = "Continia Software"
dep_version = "1.0.0.0"

# Optional: folder tree contributed by the module. Same shape as the template's
# [[extensions.folders]] — recursive, files attach at any depth.
[[module.folders]]
path = "src"

[[module.folders.folders]]
path = "codeunits"

[[module.folders.folders.files]]
path = "DocAdapter.Codeunit.al"
content = """codeunit 91000 \"{{affix}} Doc Adapter\" { }"""
```

Order of `[[module.dependencies]]` blocks is preserved.

## Catalogue TOML schema

The catalogue TOML document carries every well-known dep in one file:

```toml
[[dependency]]
dep_id = "4b915d7e-c02a-435f-85ab-649086c1e002"
dep_name = "Continia Core"
dep_publisher = "Continia Software"
dep_version_default = "1.0.0.0"
category = "Continia"

[[dependency]]
dep_id = "6f0293d3-86fc-4ff8-9632-54a580be6546"
dep_name = "ForNAV Core"
dep_publisher = "ForNAV"
dep_version_default = "1.0.0.0"
category = "ForNAV"
```

## Mustache variables (reference)

These are the variables available when seeding AL files into a generated extension. See `generation-engine.md` for substitution behaviour.

| Variable                | Description                                                |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| `{{name}}`              | Full rendered extension name                               |
| `{{workspaceName}}`     | The workspace name from the form                           |
| `{{shortName}}`         | Workspace name with whitespace removed                     |
| `{{moduleName}}`        | Module's display name (for module-cloned extensions)       |
| `{{publisher}}`         | Publisher field from defaults                              |
| `{{extension_prefix}}`  | Per-workspace short identifier from the plan, e.g. "CRO"   |
| `{{affix}}`             | `defaults.affix` when `affixType ∈ {Prefix, Suffix}`; empty when `None`. Replaces the pre-unified `{{prefix}}` / `{{suffix}}`. |
| `{{namespace}}`         | The folder path, dot-separated                             |
| `{{guid}}`              | A fresh GUID per call                                      |

## TOML as an authoring surface

Both `/admin/templates/new` and `/admin/templates/{key}` expose a TOML editor next to the structured form via a header toggle. The new-template flow opens in TOML mode by default because pasting in a `template.toml` is usually the fastest way to get a fresh template going; the edit flow opens in the structured form because surgical tweaks are what people do most often there.

Saving from TOML mode parses the textarea via Tomlyn, maps it onto the same `TemplateAuthoring` payload the structured form produces (once the structured editor is rewritten around the recursive tree), and runs through identical validation in `TemplateService.CreateAsync` / `UpdateAsync`. There is no separate code path on the way to the database.

The mapper (`Services/TemplateTomlMapper.cs`) is load-bearing infrastructure for the admin editor and the export pipeline. A few things to keep in mind:

- One TOML schema covers the admin editor, the export ZIP, and any future import-from-TOML affordance. Don't fork it.
- `deprecated` is deliberately not represented in the TOML view — flip it from the structured form's checkbox.
- Per-extension and per-folder ordering is expressed by array order; `ordering` columns are filled in from array position by the mapper.
- `[[extensions.folders.files]]` blocks make the TOML lossless even when extensions carry file content. For larger files this gets noisy; the structured editor will be the more comfortable surface for editing AL source once it's been rewritten around the recursive tree. Both write through the same pipeline, so neither is "more correct" than the other.
- Tomlyn silently drops unknown keys, so old templates that still mention `default_application` at `[template]` level or `[[folders]]` at the top level parse cleanly — they just don't produce any extensions. The mapper rewrite is responsible for surfacing this as a validation error rather than letting the import succeed with an empty extension list.

## Export to TOML

`/admin` exposes a one-click "Export all to TOML" button that produces a ZIP containing the current state of the database serialised into TOML. This is the safety hatch for:

- Periodic snapshotting into a backup branch.
- Quickly grepping/diffing the entire template state outside the app.
- Disaster recovery if the database is unrecoverable (paste the templates back via the admin TOML editor).

Implementation: walk all active rows, serialise each template/module/catalogue back into the TOML shape via `TemplateTomlMapper.ToToml`. Recursive folder trees emit `[[extensions.folders.folders]]` blocks in depth order; files emit `[[extensions.folders.files]]` (or `[[extensions.folders.folders.files]]` for nested) at the parent folder's scope. The mapper hand-emits recursive folder blocks rather than going through Tomlyn's reflection serialiser, which produces inline arrays.

## What is *not* admin-editable

- The static `.gitignore` template and the AL ruleset JSON. These ship as embedded resources under `Resources/` because they're per-deployment policy rather than per-template content. Treat them as code.
- The `README.md` boilerplate written into a generated workspace — it's emitted by `GenerationService` and shaped by template metadata, not edited directly.
- Binary files inside template or module folders. v1 stores file content as UTF-8 text only; PNGs, ZIPs, or anything else non-text don't have a place in `workspace_extension_files` / `module_extension_files`. If we need binary template assets later, the likely shape is a separate `*_file_blobs` table or a URL-fetched asset; defer until there's a real ask.

The org logo, default publisher / ID range / brief / core description, and the always-included files appended to every generated workspace **are** admin-editable from `/admin/configuration` and live in the database (`organization_assets`, `organization_settings`, `organization_files`). Fresh orgs start without any of these rows — admins fill them in once they need them.
