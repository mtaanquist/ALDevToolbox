/// <summary>
/// Shared recursive-CTE fragments for the release-ancestry chain. Every
/// find-references / dependency / interface-implementer query walks the same
/// chain and resolves each AppId to the module at the smallest depth (closest
/// to the current release) — that "winning" selection is the shadowing rule: a
/// child release sees an ancestor's module only when it doesn't ship its own
/// copy. Defining the chain + winning CTEs once keeps the queries — split
/// across <see cref="ObjectExplorerService"/> (interface-implementer outline)
/// and <see cref="ReferenceQueryService"/> (find-references / dependencies) —
/// from drifting. <c>{0}</c> is the seed release id, and each query appends
/// its own SELECT tail. <see cref="WinningModules"/> omits <c>m.name</c>;
/// <see cref="WinningModulesWithName"/> includes it for queries that report
/// the module.
///
/// <para><b>Two seeds (#901).</b> The walk starts from the release itself and
/// from the vendor releases it links in <c>oe_release_dependencies</c>, and
/// follows the ordinary parent pointer from both. <c>depth</c> is a rank, not a
/// hop count: a dependency link costs one and a parent step costs two, so the
/// order is the release (0), its dependency releases (1), its own parent (2),
/// a dependency's parent (3), and so on. That puts a vendor's objects between
/// ours and Microsoft's, and when a vendor release was ingested on top of a
/// different Business Central version than this release's, our own parent
/// still wins over the vendor's. For a release with no links the ranks are
/// 0, 2, 4, ... so every ordering is what it was. A release reachable by two
/// paths keeps its lowest rank (<c>chain</c> has one row per release). Links
/// are followed one level only: the recursive step walks parent pointers,
/// never a dependency release's own links. A rank tie between two releases
/// carrying the same app id goes to the newer release id. See
/// <c>.design/object-explorer.md</c> ("Dependency links").</para>
///
/// <para><b>Tenant fence.</b> The dependency seed joins both ends of each link
/// to <c>oe_releases</c> and keeps only a dependency in the seed release's own
/// organisation, so a link row naming another tenant's release is never
/// followed even if one were written. The parent walk relies on the argument
/// in <see cref="ChainObjectResolution"/>.</para>
